      <h1 class="h2-responsive mt0">Accurate quotes</h1>

      <p>Getting quotes is a time consuming and difficult business. Theyâ€™re hard for professionals to build and hard for customers to understand.</p>

      <p>We use a framework which makes quotes easy to understand and create. It breaks the quote down in to clear sections and items, so that costs are clear and transparent.</p>

      <p>We then pass it on to the pro to make the final tweaks and submit.</p>

      <h3>Broken down quotes</h3>

      <p>All quotes submitted by a 1ROOF member are broken down clearly into rooms and trades. This makes it far easier to see where your money is being spent and make any necessary changes before the job starts.</p>

      <h3>Fixed rates</h3>

      <p>Every member of our network has fixed rates so any additions or changes can be calculated easily. It is also possible to keep track easily on changes thanks to a flexible quote that can be updated with the customers approval.</p>

      <h3>Guarantees</h3>

      <p>Every 1ROOF pro offers guarantees. The precise details can vary depending on the project but you will be able to clearly see them on your quote.</p>
