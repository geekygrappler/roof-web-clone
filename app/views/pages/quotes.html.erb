      <h1 class="h2-responsive mt0">Accurate quotes</h1>

      <p>Getting quotes is a time consuming and difficult business. Theyâ€™re hard for professionals to build and hard for customers to understand.</p>

      <p>We use a framework which makes quotes easy to understand and create. It breaks the quote down in to clear sections and items, so that costs are clear and transparent.</p>

      <p>We then pass it on to the pro to make the final tweaks and submit.</p>

      <h3>Broken down quotes</h3>

      <p>All quotes break down into items, rooms and categories. This makes it easy to see that you're getting exactly what you want</p>

      <h3>Fixed rates</h3>

      <p>Every member of our network has their rates stored. Users can make changes and keep track of updates without fear.</p>

      <h3>Clear terms</h3>

      <p>Details such as guarantees, time frame and payment schedule are easy to view. Users can add comments and descriptions to make sure the quote is as intended.</p>
