The property is a three-bedroom flat in central London which has been rented out for the past five years. Ideally, the plan would be to redistribute its areas and make better use of the available space. 

We have an architect drawing up the new layout, but will of course need someone to implement it. :)
Here below is something I put together - as a joke really, as I clearly have no idea what I'm doing - but at least all the missing elements are there and it gives you some initial insight into what we would like to do.  http://view.planup.co.uk/id/168386905

So the works would involve taking a coupIe of walls, replacing kitchen and putting in a new utility room, possibly replacing the flooring throughout (it's currently a non-engineered wood floor - pine, very damaged and very creaky), possibly putting in underfloor heating, replacing bathtub in en-suite bathroom with a shower cabin and redecorating throughout.

We pop back to London quite often but not enough to keep a good eye on this, hence we would also need someone to run the whole project for us. ",Central London,"",London,AU,"","",,"Central London, London, United Kingdom","","",f,,,,,f,{}

Job to build a single story garage to fit 1 car and provide bicycle storage. An existing garage is to be knocked down and removed. The new garage will be built at the back of the property. 

The job will involve the following: 

Demolition of Existing Garage 
?	Removal of the existing garage flat roof. It should be assumed that this is made of asbestos sheet. This will have to be removed and disposed of safely. 
?	Knocking down of the existing garage structure. Disposal of the brick, doors and wood work in the existing garage 
?	Break up and removal of the existing concrete floor 
?	Laying topsoil down in place of the existing garage floor 

Building new garage 
?	Digging foundations for the new garage 
?	Laying a concrete floor, creating a level internal floor for the new garage 
?	Build walls and roof of the new garage 
?	Fitting new garage door and side door 

Ground-work 
?	Alterations to the small wall on the LHS of the current driveway 
?	Making good the brick-work of the driveway to meet the new boundaries of the garage side and door 

Services 
Ideally, we would like the garage to have power and lights. If this is too costly or disruptive we will exclude this from the build. 
?	Laying of armoured cable connecting new garage to the mains supply for the house 
?	Fitting ceiling lights inside the garage, with internal switch 
?	Fitting 2 x 2-way electrics wall sockets inside the garage 
?	Fitting 1 x 2-way external socket outside garage 

Have used an architect to do the drawing and have applied for a Consent for Lawful Development (planning permission not needed). 

If you are interested in the job, it might be an idea to share the specification and talk about the work. Ideally, we would like to do this work in August. The Demolition and the Build can be separate.

The width of the house is 4.8 m approx.
The stairs run up across the house roughly under the roof ridge and the loft stairs would have to be above those. The distance  from the edge of the stairs to the back wall, which would form the main area of the loft ( ie have the roof raise to ridge height with a minimal fall to the back) is approx 3.9 m.
It would be desirable to have an area of loft on the other side of the stairs for storage and a small ensuite. This area would be limited by the fall of the roof towards the street and would only extend about 1.5 to 1.8 from the stair edge towards the street.
Below the loft would be the back bedroom and bathroom and under them are a kitchen and dining room. If possible we would like to remove the wall between the kitchen and dining room using an RSJ .

I've had a water issue that slightly damaged the neighbours bathroom ceiling below. 
   Do you do any kind of quick repair of that sort....? 
 It would consist in scraping a bit of the ceiling,  fill in if needed,  and repaint the ceiling.  The ceiling surface is about 207cm(81 inches) x 157cm(61 inch).  The surface that needs to be scraped  is a line that crosses the middle of the ceiling of  about   20cm (8in)large and 100cm(39in) long.
