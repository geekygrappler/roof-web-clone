The 1ROOF Service</p><p>We appreciate your using our service at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.1roof.com">http://www.1roof.com</a> (the “Site“). Please read the Terms carefully as they govern your use of the 1ROOF service. Do not use the service unless you wish to be bound by the Terms because, by making a request for quotes and/or continuing to use any part of 1ROOF, you confirm your acceptance of the Terms (which also include the Privacy Policy and Cookies Notice). By submitting a request for quotes, you are requesting us to provide the 1ROOF service as soon as reasonably practicable.</p><p>Please note that the Terms do not apply to our service provider partners; if you are a service provider and wish to discuss working with us, please contact us at team@1roof.com.</p><p>The Service is for use in connection with home services in the United Kingdom only.</p><p>Sections 4, 5 and 10 below contain important restrictions on our liability to you – your attention is drawn to them in particular.</p><ol><li>Definitions<br><br>The provider of 1ROOF is Underoneroof Ltd. You can contact us via our online contact form or at hello@1roof.com. When the Terms make a reference to ‘we’, ‘our’ or ‘us’, that is a reference to Underoneroof Ltd.</li></ol><p>Where we refer to you in the Terms, this also includes any person that accesses or uses 1ROOF on your behalf. The “Terms” includes the terms set out here and the Privacy Policy and Cookie Notice as made available on our Site.</p><p>“1ROOF” consists of the Site, any 1ROOF-branded mobile apps we make available, any pages we operate on third party social media applications, and the content and services we make available through them via the internet or mobile devices (including smart phones and tablets). It also includes the provision by us of associated information, products and services by e-mail or your mobile device.</p><p>1ROOF is designed to enable users to submit to us details of home services projects in respect of which they require advice and/or assistance (“Requests for Quotes”) and receive responses from Service Providers with an indication of the fees chargeable by them for their provision of that advice and/or assistance and any conditions applicable to those fees (“Quotes”).</p><p>Any person whose Quote we send to you in response to your Request for Quotes, by means of 1ROOF, is a “Service Provider“.</p><p>You are responsible for accurately describing your requirements for any project in respect of which you submit a Request for Quotes (“Project“).</p><ol><li>Referral Fee Charged to Service Providers<br><br>We do not make any charge to you for use of 1ROOF. We charge Service Providers a percentage of the amounts you pay them in respect of any Project and for any work completed by the Service Provider for you during the first 18 months after the date the Service Provider is first engaged by you.</li><li>Disclaimers<br><br>We make no warranty that 1ROOF will be uninterrupted or error free, or that any defects will be corrected.</li></ol><p>Whilst we take steps to prevent misuse of our systems, we cannot warrant that 1ROOF will be free of viruses or other malicious code and accept no liability for loss or damage caused from the transmission of such code. We recommend that you always use up-to-date firewalls and anti-malware software to protect your equipment and data.</p><ol><li>You and Your Service Provider<br><br>We check that Service Providers have experience in the general field of expertise relevant to your Project (e.g. architecture, surveying, building projects). We do not endorse or recommend any particular Service Provider nor do we make any kind of guarantee as to the ability, competence, or quality of the Service Providers who may be listed on the Site. We merely make 1ROOF available to enable you to identify and determine the suitability of Service Providers for yourself. We do not warrant the accuracy, quality or completeness of any information or assistance obtained from Service Providers. We do not direct, have any control over, or make any assurance or representation about any Service Provider.</li></ol><p>If you accept any Quotes you will engage the Service Provider, without any further 1ROOF involvement in the process. We will not be a party to any contract made between you and any Service Provider and therefore we shall not be liable for any loss or damage which results from any dealings between you and any Service Provider. It is your responsibility to select a suitable Service Provider and to negotiate the terms of any Project to be performed by the Service Provider selected.<br><br>You should in all cases make your own enquiries as to the suitability of any Service Provider for your particular Project. You should not engage any Service Provider or make any deposit or other payment to them without having conducted such checks to your full satisfaction.

We do not write or control that information, and have no responsibility to you or any person for it. We ourselves may also provide you with general guidance as to questions you submit through 1ROOF. Any information on 1ROOF is for general guidance only and is not intended to be specific expert advice tailored to your particular circumstances. You should take all due care in relying on such information, as this is done at your own risk.</p><p>In the unlikely event that you have a dispute with a Service Provider, you must address such dispute directly to the Service Provider concerned, or any trade association of which such Service Provider is a member. However, you agree to notify the details of the dispute to us as soon as reasonably practicable. We cannot be involved in your disputes with Service Providers. By using 1ROOF you release us from any and all claims, demands and damages of every kind arising out of or in any way connected with any such disputes you have with one or more Service Providers.</p><ol><li>Your Use of 1ROOF<br><br>You are responsible for ensuring that you are legally entitled to submit to 1ROOF any information which you include in a Request for Quotes.
