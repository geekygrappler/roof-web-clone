      <p>Getting quotes is a time consuming and difficult business. Theyâ€™re hard for professionals to build and customers to understand.</p>

      <p>We use a framework that makes quoting easy and transparent.</p>

      <h3>Broken down</h3>

      <p>Quotes are split into rooms, categories and items. This makes it easy to see exactly what you're getting.</p>

      <h3>Fixed rates</h3>

      <p>Every member of our network has set rates. This helps customers understand the implications of any changes.</p>

      <h3>Clear terms</h3>

      <p>Quotes includes details such as guarantees, time frame and payment schedule. Setting out these terms helps to ensure a project runs smoothly. </p>
