      <p>We set up 1ROOF after experiencing first hand how difficult arranging improvements for busy homeowners in London was.</p>

      <p>We spent years researching different ways to improve the experience. We've built an instant estimator and project mangement system but realised they only solved parts of the bigger issue.</p>

      <p>It became clear that not much could be done unless the project got off to the right start. Itâ€™s essential to get an understandable quote from an appropriate professional. No-one was providing this.</p>

      <p>So this is what 1ROOF does - provide a broken down quote and a hand picked professional for any home improvement project.</p>
