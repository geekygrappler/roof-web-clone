<p><strong>How long have you been building?</strong></p>

<p>Forever really. My dad was a furniture maker so I’ve been working with wood since I was about 5.</p>

<p><strong>How did you start this company?</strong></p>

<p>I did a degree in designing and making furniture and advised some big companies like Habitat and John Lewis. Then me and my friend Toby thought we should put our skills together and start up on our own. It’s gone really well, we focus heavily on using the best materials and are very busy.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think is the most important thing in your profession?</strong></p>

<p>Kitchens are very personal so you have to really understand the customer and what they want to get out of theirs. We do a lot of talking and planning first to really get to the heart of what people want.</p>

<p><strong>What jobs do you specialise in?</strong></p>

<p>Kitchens, believe it or not. But we do most renovation work. Just nothing with too much steel.</p>
